# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection
The Fogg Method and Tiny Habits appeal most to me out of everything I explored today. They expand on some of the concepts I recently read about in a book by Traci Mann, called Secrets from the Eating Lab. That's a book about food/nutrition/dieting but she addresses methods for behavior modification that talk about setting new habits or altering old ones. I like the way Tiny Habits ties setting new habits with activities I already participate in (like pushups after peeing).

Time Boxing is something I've been thinking about previously. I prefer to stay in the Zone for longer periods, so the Pommodor Technique has never appealed to me. But Time Boxing focuses on fitting productivity into certain parts of the day, yet allows me to create longer slots to work within. I'd like to start using timers to force myself to work within designated time periods, and also to structure my time so that I'm not always late to everything or neglecting other areas of my life (which leads me to feel anxious when I get up from the computer and realize how many other things I still need to get to). Right now I use a combination of to-do list (Remember the Milk app) and calendering (Google Calendar). A timer app might be a nice addition, forcing me to sit down to DBC at 9am every day, breaking for lunch, and stopping in the afternoon to focus on other things. I also think I need to start going to bed earlier and waking up earlier. Once I get the kids in bed I'm usually too tired to really get anything productive done.
# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection
1. I do not know what a shell is. The window into the inner workings of the computer? Bash is the specific program used to interact with the system. Ubuntu is another one, like Bash. I think?
2. I did this assignment over multiple days and I think it slowed down my memorization because I had to keep going back and refresh my memory on what the basic commands do.

3. Yes, although I'm still struggling to understand pushd and popd and why I wouldn't use a combination of cd, cd.. and ls instead.

4. cd, cd .., ls, and less. The most basic, but they are orientation commands that help you understand where you are and what's around you. You can't begin to manipulate the data until you master those.

5.

pwd - print working directory. If bash tells me I'm in the temp folder, it's important to know if I'm in the temp folder on my Desktop or the one I created in my Pictures file

ls - list, lists all items in the current location

mv - move files from one place to another. mv FileToBeMoved WhereToMoveIt

cd - typing in just this will take you home, typing cd PlaceToMoveTo will take you deeper into the place where you are (the directory where you are?)

../ - I do not know what this does.

touch - create something from the terminal. "touch Jenna.txt" makes a text file named Jenna

mkdir - create a new directory (folder) in the current location

less - show the contents of the item in question in a way that allows the user to page through the data within

rmdir - remove a directory, only works when the directory is empty

rm - remove the thing indicated. rm -r will eliminate a directory that has items inside of it.

help - pair help with a command and the terminal will tell you what that command does


# 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

Creating a new repo: Once a new user profile has been set up on GitHub, navigate to your profile. Select "repositories" tab and then on the right-hand side select "New". Name and choose the correct license for your respository.

Forking a repo: Forking a repo is like discovering your friend has some sourdough starter on her windowsill, when you've been wanting to make your own sourdough bread but lacked something to start it with! You can borrow some of her starter without affecting her bread baking efforts in the future. Once you've found a respository that has what you are looking for, navigate to the right side of the window and hit "fork". Select the profile where you would like to import the repository. Now you can make changes without affecting the original content created by someone else.

Cloning a repo: You aren't going to want to make all of your changes using the GitHub site in your browser. Real programmers use the terminal. Hiyah! After creating or forking your repo scroll down to the right side of the screen and copy the code from the box that has "HTTPS" above it. Open your terminal and type "git clone InsertURLHere", substituting the URL with the one you copied from GitHub. Now all of the files exist on your computer as well.



I didn't have any struggles. The instructions here were really well-written and easy to follow!
