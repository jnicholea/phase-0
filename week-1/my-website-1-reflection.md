## 4. Open Source and Repo Setup Reflection

- Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
- Describe what open source means.
- What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
- Assess the importance of using licenses.
- What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

<p>-Create a repository on GitHub by opening up your profile, selecting the Repositories tab, and clicking on the green box "New". Copy your repository from GitHub to your computer (remote to local). Make sure your terminal is pointed to directory where you want repository to be cloned. "git clone insert_url_from_github". Type "ls" to check and make sure repository copied correctly. Type "cd name_of_repository" to navigate into the correct directory. You will know it's the correct one if the terminal now points to "name_of_repository [master] :>".</p>
<p>-Open source means the end result is paired with the code that runs it, allowing anyone to manipulate the code and change the end result</p>
<p>-I think open source makes the world better by allowing everyone to build off of exisiting ideas. When creating something new that has the potential to be very valuable I wonder if a good model would be to intially use a proprietary model to protect market share, and then move to an open source model to allow others to benefit from your innovation. I might feel differently about that if I had a really brilliant idea I wanted to protect :).</p>
<p>-This is the challenge where I finally forced myself to break down the push/pull process and being able to quickly type in commands and create branches that I then push/pull on GitHub was a really great feeling. It made me feel like I was falling behind on the other assignments for this week but I can tell I'll have a lot easier time getting through future challenges.</p>
