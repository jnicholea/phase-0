//Pseudocode
// 1. Create a die-rolling game that prompts user to enter a guess, rolls the die, 
// and checks whether the roll matches the guess.
// 2. Initialize a die with six-sides.
// 3. Prompt for guess. Store user guess.
// 4. Computer selects random number between 1-6. 
// 5. Check to see if user guess and random number match.
// 6. Declare winner if it is a match, encourage to play again if not.

//Reflection
// - What concepts did you solidify in working on this challenge?
//     - I styled the page using CSS, formatted the page using HTML, wrote the functions using Javascript, and integrated JQuery as well. I’m so proud of my work today!
// - What was the most difficult part of this challenge?
//     - Everything that involved figuring out how to make actions happen on click. Swapping out the images for a win/loss took me awhile because I was having trouble with scope.
// - Did you solve the problem in a new way this time?
//     - My genius BIL is staying with us and he is fabulous tech support. I wish I had that all the time.
// - Was your pseudocode different from the Ruby version?
//     - I didn’t pay much attention. I knew I wanted to use the “die challenge” loosely and make a game around that concept.
