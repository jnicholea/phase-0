		<!-- It's hard to resist the temptation to not style it, but I love to see what I can create entirely from scratch! Watching my changes transform onto the screen when I refresh is one of my favorite parts about programming -->
		<!-- Sites like W3 make it very easy -->
		<!-- I failed miserably at no formatting in the HTML. Both because I want to make things look pretty, but also because I swear when I paired with someone on this on Monday the assignment was different and didn't mention anything about styling. Or I blocked that part, conveniently. -->
		<!-- HTML is simple to learn and easy to manipulate, but it's extremely limited in its functionality. Now that I can do a little bit more with CSS and Javascript it feels very restrictive. -->
		<!-- Google is your best friend. Repetition will get you the rest of the way. -->
