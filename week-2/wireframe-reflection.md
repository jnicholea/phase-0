What is a wireframe?
1. A wireframe is a visual representation of the bare bones layout of a website. Does not worry about content, only concerned with the way the "boxes" of a site fit within the grid. 
What are the benefits of wireframing?
2. Wireframing quickly mocks up where content will go without worrying about what the content is. The layout is very important because it dictates how users with interact with the content and what they will click on and engage with during their visits.
Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
3. Yes. It felt like I was visually jumping ahead past the coding and developing of the site to see what it will actually look like when it is done.
Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
4. I looked up some ideas on Pinterest and then felt like it came together really easily.
What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
5. I was stuck on the portion where we were asked to link the images using the relative path. It's because I used ../ at the beginning of my code instead of ./, which is what I needed to use. I actually wasn't able to solve it until I asked a friend to look over my code with me and point out what was wrong. 
Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
6. I didn't find any of it tedious. I thought wireframing was really fun and it further reinforced that I would enjoy doing front-end web development.
